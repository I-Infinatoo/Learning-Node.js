sharing the file to other system :
    Project will be shared without the <node_modules> folder, as it is the files which are used by the dependencies used in the project.
    Uploading a file to any where (with "node_modules" folder) will result in the project having tons of files and folders init, which can result in failure during the upload.

    So, share the project without the "node_modules" folder.

    After downloading the project run "npm install" in the root directory of the project to get the "node_modules" folder back.
